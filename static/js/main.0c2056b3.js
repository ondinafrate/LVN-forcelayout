And all of a sudden, it\'s your issue, but you won\'t help me with the situation that caused you guys to build. I mean, we would like to see people continue to show us... When you say you\'re going to do something for us, equal wage for women, as much as men, we want you to stand to your word. And we appreciate everything that Boston has done for us these days, your food. And as far as the fact that the food things comes with, you give people the walk food and then it\'s a lot of waste, too much waste. I mean, we\'re blessed to have food, but the thing about it is, sometimes, you give the people the things they don\'t want in bags and then they leave it on the streets. And then this is another issue that really hurts my spirit, it\'s what are they doing... What is it? 10 Mile? Methadone Mile. Methadone Mile. I mean, okay, you give them a place or they took a place over there to live with tents, but the City does not go over there and clean it up, just like they\'re dogs. You wouldn\'t even treat a dog like that. I mean, where\'s the government? Where\'s the people that are cleaning our streets? You keep paying people to clean our streets in Dorchester, Roxbury, and we got to go looking around and see all this trash, masks and stuff all over the place. It\'s not right.

She was like, she\'s 48 and she was in elementary school so it was a long time ago. And my landlady who had bought the house for... It was a three family house we were living in, raise my rent from 700 to 1100 in one year and I had to move. And so, we moved to Jamaica Plain. And then several years later... I mean, I was real mad and angry, even though I was a leader of the Brookline Tenant Union, coordinated the entire towns\' election and all the 20 precincts, and I just felt powerless and just left and contested. Anyway, a couple of years later, in \'95 or \'96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn\'t making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it. That apartment, it\'s your basic triple decker, tens of thousands of other triple deckers, not the whole building, just one floor, a thousand square feet, two bedrooms and a front room is now assessed by the city at about $500,000. I mean, that\'s crazy to me. So, how can anyone... I mean, I could never buy that house now, even though I make good money. And my daughter who moved to Phil... She\'s 48, bought a house in Philadelphia for 200 and something thousand dollars, could never, even though she makes a lot of money with her partner. So, that\'s my question. And that\'s my story. I mean, I was able to do it because I\'m old, I\'m 74, in \'95/\'96 I could buy this place with 72,000 and maybe by inflation, it might be 150 if normal inflation would take place, but it\'s 500. So, that\'s my question, how has anyone who\'s not a gazillionaire going to be able to live and stay in Boston. That\'s my story. And I\'m sticking with it.

Now, the problem is that Walsh, because of his ties to construction industry let developers take over this initiative and the developers, they\'re not so interested in quality of life issues or even in costs. Now they came up with this term called affordable housing, which is actually a developers term and what it amounts to is a slight reduction of rent for a year. Now, that\'s not really going to help a lot of people in the long run, but it provided the developers with an excuse who I erect here in my part of towns, literally hundreds of high rises, which is going to have a completely disastrous effect in terms of climate change issues in the near future, and the delivery of city services, including water and sewer, electric service is going to be deteriorated because every source has already said they don\'t want to provide more equipment. So we\'re facing a crisis of infrastructure mainly, and also a surging population that we can\'t possibly handle, because I mean, the rat situation here in this part of town is already out of control, as you know rats bring disease and cause other problems. So we\'re looking at, between one issue and the other, we\'re looking at it very large deficit in terms of quality of life in the near future. What can be done about it?

Nobody wants to do that because they\'re a very powerful organization, but I don\'t see another solution.

Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they\'ve benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn\'t know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I\'ve been here, I\'ve been in Boston since 1972. That\'s a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There\'s no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that\'s because of the racial difference and it\'s just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.","highlight_speakers":"Nurys, Multi Mode Mama","tags":["community life.community relationships","discrimination.race-based"]},{"conversation_id":"1512","conversation_date":"2021-10-05","highlight_id":"4133585","highlight_start":"1918.3","highlight_end":"1923.9","highlight_words":"So why isn\'t Boston preparing the youth to be financial literate?","highlight_speakers":"Jesus","tags":["economic opportunity.financial literacy"]},{"conversation_id":"1512","conversation_date":"2021-10-05","highlight_id":"4133586","highlight_start":"1925.4","highlight_end":"2006.8","highlight_words":"That is a question that I\'ve asked myself and I don\'t understand why today there\'s still nothing around that.

Racism is throughout the United States. I\'m an advocate for education and it\'s a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you\'re in Boston and I\'m hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don\'t want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I\'m really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they\'re fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they\'re not courageous or they\'re afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that\'s my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there\'s no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.","highlight_speakers":"Daphne","tags":["government and institutions.expectations","public health.covid-19","education.systemic inequality","education. quality of education","discrimination.race-based"]},{"conversation_id":"1512","conversation_date":"2021-10-05","highlight_id":"4133590","highlight_start":"2228.9","highlight_end":"2386.7","highlight_words":"why are our schools in Boston still segregated in terms of I guess race? In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there\'s like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it\'s like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I\'ve been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I\'m in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that\'s not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it\'s happening but also like why is it happening? But it\'s just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren\'t we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they\'re doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they\'re supposed to be.","highlight_speakers":"Naomie","tags":["education.systemic inequality","education. quality of education","discrimination.race-based","discrimination.class-based"]},{"conversation_id":"1512","conversation_date":"2021-10-05","highlight_id":"4133592","highlight_start":"2418.1","highlight_end":"2503.6","highlight_words":"So I\'ve been teaching at BPS for a month, but I\'ve been teaching overall for seven years.

I understand, not to say I definitely don\'t agree, but I understand where some of the stuff is coming from based off of just how BPS is run and how certain things, and I\'m not trying to like downplay BPS like it\'s a bad organization, but we definitely have a lot of work to do and I just think that that was my experience of, why not be BPS. Why can\'t somebody from BPS go to Harvard. Don\'t downplay BPS, don\'t downplay the students in BPS. They have so much potential just like students that are in different parts of Massachusetts, whether they\'re in the suburbs, whether they\'re in the city, they definitely are capable of the same thing.

I really didn\'t know what to do except to actually go and get them some food and sit there on the sidewalk with them and just listen to them. And basically, at that point, that\'s what they needed, just somebody to listen and really believe. They needed some help.

And they would spit on me, drunk, and I would have to go into Cub Scout smelling of liquor and spit. I can still smell the liquor. One of the opening songs we were saying is my country ... Or recite, \\"My country, \'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty,\\" but I didn\'t feel very free. Fast forward, as the executive director of the community center I used to go to as a child, as the assistant director going into the director, I was initiated with the child steward tragedy in 1989 in October. I can remember the date and time, seeing black men being strip-searched, civil rights savagely violated. I\'m being the director and I had to turn around because I didn\'t want to be subjected to it. These were my friends. These were my participants in the community center, people that grew up with me, family members. Actually, my cousin, who was a former city councilor, was one of the kids. I skipped over something very important because I know that education is pointing ... And this has been in the news. One of the most prominent high schools in the city of Boston throughout the country, the first public school ... In the seventh grade, I was accepted in Boston Latin. I did not want to go there, but my mother made me go there. But during my tenure there in the seventh grade, I was called the N-word by a teacher.

It marginalized people of color, it marginalized women, marginalized LGBTQ, all that youth. And I think education is a source of all opportunity and all growth and all wealth. So I speak from my experience, because I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with Arne Duncan, who is the former Secretary of Education. And this was a meeting where students from all across the country, we sat down, we talked with him. And we just got to talk, what is our education system looking like? And I\'m from Boston, Harvard\'s down the sheet, Wentworth, MIT, all these schools.

So why is it that we don\'t have classes on financing? Why can\'t we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden? How to cook for yourself? How to buy a car? How to do these things? Why does our family members have to do this on our own and teach and teach us when.\\" I feel it makes sense in education system, we should be learning that specific fact. I mean, the weather cycle is great and all, but teach the foundations of life first and then you can proceed to electives as in like, language and... I mean, language is of course important but teach stuff on first. And it\'s interesting because I think that that\'s something education is once we\'re going to do it, you have to be a public school, or a private school, or a charter school to start your own curriculum. But I think that it\'s important to start teaching, especially Black and Brown youth, we shouldn\'t wait until you\'re in your 20s to start learning about finance.

And I feel we see a lot of buildings and affordable housing units and all these things being pop up, but the demand for is still not being met. So my personal experience is I entered the lottery for one of these new buildings, and the lotteries through the city, but then once you get accepted, it then gets pushed to the property management company. And the property management companies have tactics in place to deter folks from actually being placed within those units. So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that\'s being funded by the taxpayers, that\'s being built by the city, and all these different things, and it\'s just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately. And in a space where there\'s a lot of just disorganization, and they\'re not being honest about things. And they\'re saying, \\"Oh, this person\'s rejecting it, and not creating a full picture.\\" We\'re never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you\'re not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don\'t meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there\'s just no accountability period for anyone. Folks just get to do what they want to do, they put a really great picture on, they write eloquent words, they create this whole pie chart and graphs without actually implementing any other measures or showing all the progress that was made. And no one goes back and says, \\"Well, we know we want to be able to audit your paperwork, we want to be able to see what it is that you\'re doing.

It mean something different for everybody. Affordable housing means to me, me now working two jobs to pay my rent, me spending time with my child instead of always at work. And then on Saturday, I\'m cramming all this quality time with my child. So that\'s basically what I did. There was no community and what happened to the affordable community centers, right? So and then, growing up, I grew up with my son. And basically, I had to work two jobs, just to maintain, to make sure that he... I was a single mom, make sure he was able to go into programs and go to community centers and stuff like that. But I got to work in order for him to do that. You know what I mean? And the centers wasn\'t cheap. The program wasn\'t cheap. And me, because I couldn\'t afford education, [inaudible] had the money for it, my years and... So there\'s another question, education versus years and your position. If I got the experience, years of experience, but I don\'t have the education, when does that going to count again? Just because somebody was able to afford a education doesn\'t mean that they have knowledge and understanding or understand the population that they\'re dealing with. So I couldn\'t get those high paying jobs, because didn\'t had a education, but I had the experience, you know what I mean? So it goes all the way back to the affordable housing, I would be content, if I didn\'t have to raise my child and make sure he was equipped. If I didn\'t have to work two jobs, it\'s hard trying to juggle school work and your child, you know what I mean? So, I think we need to bring back affordable housing which is really affordable to middle class people, working people because when you are working, in my experience, you can\'t get certain benefits, you can\'t get TAFDC, you can\'t get food stamps, snap as you all call it benefits anymore, because you are overqualified. You have to qualify first before you can get this snap. And so stuff like that helps and it benefits your child. But the working class, if we make over a certain amount, we can get that affordable housing, quote, unquote, we can get the support that other families can get. And people that, basically, I\'m not going to say we don\'t need it. But what I\'m saying is, we all need it. We all need support. We all need a hand. So, don\'t look at my income and say that it\'s less than somebody else that has lower income. My needs is the same as that other person. So if my needs are not being met, right? How can I afford it? So their needs is not being met by this programming to help them meet those needs. But there\'s no programming for us middle class. So my question is, when are we going to have affordable housing?

And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system. And so as an experiment, I thought that this is a skewed experiment because what you\'re doing is that you\'re loading the experimental school. If you\'re really trying to understand what could be a more advantageous school system or whatever, and you put it with folks who, in a lot of way anybody whose kid was doing well in the traditional system wouldn\'t take them out and put them in an experiment. So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results. When I see that happening again, I see the same ideas about trying to open up the classroom and trying to not have grades and trying to design schools that try to meet the students where they are and just going through the same cycle.

How do we use this to educate people about our people and their values? I think this leads to having more ownership and more say in what we do in our communities. I think there are important folks, important leaders, people who don\'t have enough voice, I would say, or enough ownership with what they\'re doing and how they\'re creating community and leading.

There\'s not enough of us out there becoming young leaders for the youth, so it\'s about really painting a bigger picture for the future. I know this because I\'m in Upham\'s Corner community, and I feel like a lot of the people who I feel are leaders, are not represented enough to be able to carry through with their legacy, and with the moves that they want to make, because we don\'t have a place where the vision is held, like archived of all this stuff. Where we can say, \\"This is proven to be done and we need these people back again.\\" I just think that there should be more say. A lot of people should have a better say, more voice around what they want to see in their community. But we have to preserve the legacy and also bring that back into the educational system, which will hopefully amplify the historical landmarks that we have, so they can\'t be erased. I want to advocate for that more. I think there\'s a lot of neighborhood legacy. I want to advocate for that, just try to make that something before it just disappears, and it\'s not the same anymore. Create a better community by educate with the youth too, about where they\'re at, because the community is special too.

I\'ve had a ton of career just roadblocks because I\'m a woman or because I\'m Asian or because there\'s a misunderstanding about my level of education or knowledge. So there\'s all of these little roadblocks within individual experience that we don\'t address and when you keep telling people that you work hard, you\'ll get there.

When I worked in tech, it was insane to me that they were paying me so much just for an assistant level position whereas when I was doing something that I loved in design, I was making less than all of my peers. So no matter how hard I worked or how much further along, I move through moved up in whatever industry is like that, trying to close that gap was an uphill battle.

And now moving back towards the city is not an option for me personally, just because of the cost of housing, as previously mentioned. And I think that this is a extremely pressing issue, just because I think there\'s this attraction to Boston from top talent, for our top universities, for medical care for these hospitals that young doctors want to work at. All of these great, like high-end resources that are attracting outside talent, when there\'s also that talent within Boston. I think there needs to be more of an effort to provide those resources to people who are from Boston and willing to put in the work, because there are students in Boston Public Schools, in the Boston Metro Area that are willing to do that. But living in Boston just isn\'t an option because of the cost of actually living in the city and being close to those amenities outside of living with family or friends.

So just being at different community meetings. One, specifically in South End, I don\'t want to go too much in detail, but just seeing how developers and just leaders of the communities and seeing how they can... It seems like the actual people live in the communities are actually marginalized, even within the community meeting.

So yeah, I think the main experience is coming to a city as a transplant, recognizing there\'s a lot of shared struggle and oppression that I do have with people that look like me, but there\'s also a really big gap in the experiences between transplants like me and people who have been here and want to stay here and just no longer can afford to.","highlight_speakers":"Somala","tags":["housing.gentrification and displacement","housing.housing affordability","housing.systemic inequality","discrimination.race-based"]},{"conversation_id":"1441","conversation_date":"2021-09-08","highlight_id":"3602787","highlight_start":"2313.3","highlight_end":"2321.9","highlight_words":"My question is, what is the city going to do intentionally and strategically do to address the racist reputation that it has?","highlight_speakers":"Davo","tags":["government and institutions.accountability","government and institutions.processes","government and institutions.systemic inequality","discrimination.race-based"]},{"conversation_id":"1441","conversation_date":"2021-09-08","highlight_id":"3602786","highlight_start":"2276.6","highlight_end":"2295.5","highlight_words":"I want to know, what\'s actually possible.

But everyone is just like, \\"Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood.\\" And I think people don\'t think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston. And I think a lot of people have concerns about going to different neighborhoods, just because of what they think that neighborhood is, or what each neighborhood could be like. And especially coming from abroad, everyone\'s tells you not to go to a certain neighborhood within Boston, or they just say, \\"Oh, all this neighborhood is just the same way.\\" Which is definitely not true.

Because we have a toddler, and we\'ll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don\'t want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices. So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you\'re dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you\'ll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston.

Mine is what does the climate control look like because there\'s a concern about the water levels rising, and what does that look like and who is in charge of that project that needs to be discussed with the homeowners and the business owners and the commuters and other people that can be affected. In addition to that if there was a situation, well there will be a situation. It\'s just a matter of time. They say what does that evacuation look like? Where is that discussion at because that\'s really important for people that live in the community that don\'t know? I know there were some evacuation signs, but I was told there really wasn\'t ... And the other thing is the tyranny that goes along with we voted for cannabis and consumption, and the stigmatization that went along with people who did smoke cannabis. And then you have these judges that lock up a lot of cannabis users. And now some of these judges, I wouldn\'t say all of them, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if they\'re not in the cannabis industry. Those judges that sent these young, and I say black and brown and Latino people to jail including my loved one. My family was incarcerated because they were an addict and they used drugs to provide for their addiction. What about crime? But they still did jail time unlike the addicts of today that they want to find them injection centers. They\'re not injection centers but there are places where they can go and indulge in the activity of their choice. They want to provide shelters for these addicts of today. They want to put them on Front Street in the prime areas where there\'s business owners. There\'s a black hotel down there. We won\'t even know that it\'s a black hotel. When it was open, we did very much go over there and have a great time, but now with the drug addiction people that are surrounding those areas who\'s helping those business owners to get back to the level where they deserve to get the revenue that they deserve. But because of the eyesore like where\'s that conversation at. And the consumerism, we can go into the cigar bars and you can go into the bars and you can do hookah, and you can do cigars. You can\'t do cannabis, but we voted for that, like you owe us that. There\'s tyranny there. And who\'s talking about that? It\'s not okay. It\'s just not okay. And then I know there\'s a whole 2030 Boston blueprint and what it\'s supposed to look like, the metropolis that they\'re building around us. We don\'t see that in the urban community unless you go down to City Hall and you\'re aware of ... We\'ll just go over all of it. If you\'re aware of the protocol that they have for that. And the last thing is Nathaniel Holland Fenway Park. Those parks are for the people, but the people can\'t use them. In other words, there was just a write-up in the Globe that Fenway had never had lined the Urban Act in the whole history of the Fenway Park. I have never, ever wanted to say, \\"Hey son, let\'s go to Fenway Park for an hour.\\" Never, and I take my kids on a lot of outings. And the other thing is the youth center, when I played football and one of the things I always was very happy about in all the years that I played with my children is when we go to those games the people who support them always had a banner, so we knew who the business owners that support our children.

And the credit score and everything was changing where I did have a decent credit score, but everything was changing. There was a lull for like two or three years where it didn\'t seem like anyone could buy anything. You know what I\'m saying? With the whole watching ... Like I said, with watching housing change where there were housing being sold, three family homes, like I live in Dorchester. For instance, living here in Dorchester versus someone who may live in Roxbury where they started talking about the word regentrification. To be on this side of how everyone had to highlight on Roxbury, I\'m one of the people who living here in this community would say that Dorchester is being regentrified, and no one was paying attention to that because like I said the three family homes were being sold, but they\'re being sold and they\'re being turned into condos, and how do you turn a three family home and all of a sudden start saying that these are condo floors, and each floor now costs $360,000 versus a home, that whole home would run you $500,000. You know what I\'m saying? I personally witnessed that. That\'s where my question comes from with the formula in pricing based of ... Where I think the housing crash happened, it took away, I think, the American dream of a hard working person owning a home and being able to own a home and say possibly use one of their floors to be their small business or like I said a second income. That\'s what I\'ve seen with the what happened to housing since 2008, and the way that is continuing. That\'s a part of the whole plan of where she says the whole plan of before was what was Boston going to look like in 2020, and now the whole vision is 2030, and just that part like where is rent going to go from here if an average three bedroom apartment if you can get it to say apartment and not condo is running like $2,200, $2,300 and more. There\'s something a lot of people who have decent jobs that work for the T, that work for the police, I work for the city, one of the city department divisions, and that\'s astronomical to be asking somebody to spend $2,000 a month.

As a child when the white boys, white girls busting our windows out I\'m looking out the window peeking. And we\'d call the cops. They\'d come, do nothing, absolutely nothing. So as a little girl watching this, my mom walking around the house with a football helmet because bricks was coming through the windows. It got so back the Black Panthers actually came to Maverick projects to help us, to assist us because the cops never ever did anything for us. So my whole life I\'ve endured this kind of racism on the police force, as a parent living in the projects in South Street watching my son and his friends being harassed constantly by the police. And there\'s never ever, in my opinion, my own experiences, there\'s never ever been anything but racism that I\'ve seen. And then I think about the black cops. When are you going to show up for us? You\'re sitting in the cruisers with these folks. I was arrested for trying to defend my son in my home. Called them to my home. I\'m in the back of a cruiser, and the white boy, because that\'s what they are to me, says to me, \\"What do you do for a living?\\" As he\'s transporting me to the jail, and I said, \\"None of your business.\\" And his response to that was, \\"Probably nothing. You\'re just like the rest of them collecting a check.\\" [inaudible]. That\'s what we endure. And at this age, 61 years old still enduring that kind of racism in the police force, so what is going to be done? Who\'s going to help us? We need some assistance with these folks that are supposed to protect and serve. I think it\'s just generational racism. Who are they now? The white boys that were busting my windows out, who are they now? Where are they now? Are they teaching my grandchildren with that racist spirit? Is this why our kids can\'t learn because you talk about generational wealth, what about generational racism? That\'s what I\'ve endured. That\'s my question, when is there going to be some police reform and something has to be done about this racism on the force. When are they going to see us as people and human like the rest of them?

There\'s a lot of walks and different things for breast cancer and different things like that, but there\'s no things that minorities know about or feel comfortable participating in. And I think that if there was more preventative healthcare minorities would probably live longer because there\'s a lot of health issues that are hereditary things that are killing black men and women, but also I think that it\'s hard to get good healthcare in Boston if you don\'t have the right health insurance.

So I think that I experiencing it for so long and not seeing it being resolved or get any better, I think that it makes us feel hopeless. I\'m assuming you\'re Mel King son, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So your father have been carrying on pretty good fight. Remember when he ran for mayor and you would think all the hard work he had put out things would be better. So you wouldn\'t be having this discussion, but here we are, I mean the same discussion. So my personal opinion is that I think you get to a point where it wears you down and makes you feel hopeless. I think what we probably need is some hope, a breath of fresh air. One of the things someone comment on, is the voting and everyone concentrate on the presidential vote. I think, I\'m not speaking for him, but I think in my mind, when Obama was running, we were hopeful. \\"Wow, things are getting better.\\" And I think that\'s what we need in our community right here in Boston. We don\'t see things are getting better. We\'re not feeling it. So, we\'re kind of in the dumps a little bit.

My question is like, well, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? Are they even ready for a Black mayor? I say that with the full understanding of they had their... Massachusetts had the first Black senator ever elected, the second Black governor ever elected. And during this time where the plight of people of color are elevated and they had three strong candidates on the ballot, none of them made it through. To me, that felt like... that was a blow. I was like, that was crazy to me. I couldn\'t even fathom that, especially when I looked at around, at one point in time, I think last year, maybe even this year, Boston had a Black district attorney, Black sheriff, Black chief... I mean commissioner, excuse me. But basically had Blacks in every level of law enforcement at the highest level. I don\'t know. And I\'m thinking like, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? That\'s why I checked in like intellectual. Because to me, that\'s something... I think this was the best chance ever to have a Black man and it never happened. I know that I\'ve been in Massachusetts a long time and I\'ve known somebody become the mayor, they\'re there till they die, they leave, or they go somewhere else.

Different kinds of flavor, and you could walk into these spaces and get that kind of flavor, that kind of culture, that kind of... All those things that come along with food. And you could walk in there... I\'ve actually recently visited, and it\'s not the same. It\'s not that kind of thing that it used to be, when I lived out there for 12 years. And I\'m starting to see that in Boston as well. I\'m starting to see, I think, on a negative front, a lot of places getting pushed out farther and farther. You\'re starting to see places go into Malden and Quincy, and that\'s cool. I\'m glad that places are still existing, but those places, some of them used to be in Boston. On the more positive front, I\'m also starting to see some new spaces coming up, like 50 Kitchen, in Dorchester, that\'s a pretty awesome spot. There\'s a couple real cool spots out in... I mentioned Somerville, but I know my friend Elliot has a restaurant called Tanam, that\'s out near Bow Street Market, so there\'s these little gems that I\'m starting to see, but not as fast as these other places are going away. So my question is really about, how do we keep those old pieces that I... I loved visiting those markets. I loved going to those spots, and in the Mission District in San Francisco, and I also like some of these new spots. And so I\'m like, \\"How do we keep that\\"? That variety of, what I\'m calling, flavor.","highlight_speakers":"Kim","tags":["housing.gentrification and displacement"]},{"conversation_id":"1521","conversation_date":"2021-10-02","highlight_id":"4213000","highlight_start":"1182.3","highlight_end":"1182.9","highlight_words":"What you going to do about the police department?","highlight_speakers":"Nelson","tags":["government and institutions.accountability","safety.policing"]},{"conversation_id":"1521","conversation_date":"2021-10-02","highlight_id":"4212996","highlight_start":"906.9","highlight_end":"939.3","highlight_words":"I used to live in Cambridge and I went and come back and live in Boston.

Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I\'ve noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It\'s like, it\'s really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that\'s going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn\'t know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that\'s not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it\'s like, \\"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\\" So it\'s, I don\'t know, it\'s always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn\'t an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don\'t like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don\'t have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person\'s child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don\'t have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that\'s my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit...

This is where we need to be.\\" Then the question becomes, \\"Okay, so how do we rewrite the story and get these folks out of the way, so that we can have our ultra-luxury city?\\" You nailed it. And I think the thing that does bring some, I think joy and a bit of solace to me is the fact that I believe people learned a very valuable lesson from the South End and people being bought out and literally having property stole from under them, because the reality is, we don\'t see the blueprints, 40 years, 20 years, 10 years out.

I know that they\'re streaming it on Showtime, YouTube, and other things. I don\'t know if anyone knows Dennis Wilson, but he\'s one of the [crosstalk]. And he is one of the co-producers of the show. Yeah, and you\'re absolutely right. There\'s not enough, very constructive and engaging things for children to do. I see that with my own grandchildren. I have to make these things happen. And with everybody, and being in such a financial slump and stuff, it\'s very difficult. But especially at this time, we need to start to rebuild these children so that they can have some hope and joy. Like have a childhood? Well, yes. Because the trauma and everything, and that they\'ve experienced in the last year and a half... Seen a huge increase in the bullying, the meanness. So we have a lot of... Again, we have a lot of work to do. For me, this is like, excuse my expression, but, \\"It\'s like shoveling shit against the tide.\\" We were there in the eighties and the nineties with the drugs and all of that sort of stuff. But I know that things can change because it did. We just got to keep our foot on the pedal and make sure these services are there, especially for the children coming behind us.","highlight_speakers":"Marilyn Foreman, Gail","tags":["education.youth spaces"]},{"conversation_id":"1529","conversation_date":"2021-10-11","highlight_id":"4263500","highlight_start":"2093.4","highlight_end":"2308.7","highlight_words":"Well, I think that for me, my question would be, \\"Who\'s at the table?\\" So I am not a native Bostonian. I\'m not a native New Englander. I am from Georgia. And I was born and grew up in the heart of the civil rights era. So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who\'s at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn\'t a table, he\'d build one. And you don\'t leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street. We used to know all of our neighbors. So when you talk about the kids having things to do and places to go, that wasn\'t so much an issue because all of our households had a hand in making that happen for kids. I can truthfully say to you now that I can\'t really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I\'ll do stuff for them, I\'ll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them. But they see me and they go, \\"Hi neighbor.\\" That\'s our life now. It used to be that we knew them, they knew us. We knew about each other. We knew how to help each other. It was more than just a casual wave to someone, \\"Hey, how you\'re doing?\\" So, that\'s missing. So now I think that in our community conversations... I think much like this call, it needs to be intergenerational. It\'s got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shamika and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who\'s at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we\'re not there, we get them there. And if we need to, we need to build another table that\'s big enough to accommodate everybody so that we can all be a part of the conversation.","highlight_speakers":"Alvida","tags":["government and institutions.processes","community life.community relationships"]},{"conversation_id":"1529","conversation_date":"2021-10-11","highlight_id":"4263501","highlight_start":"2319.3","highlight_end":"2524.0","highlight_words":"I think what led me to my question... I\'ve been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they\'re facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it\'s either they turn to their peers or they\'re keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \\"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\\" And so for me, it was just very looking for, \\"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don\'t want to go to school, they don\'t want to take classes, but it\'s so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they\'re passionate about, they\'re so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They\'re like, \\"Let me just... I\'ll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens.\\" And oftentimes there\'s not this... They don\'t often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can\'t remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, \\"Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success.\\" And, yes, if that\'s [inaudible], but success doesn\'t have to be limited to getting a bachelor\'s. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it\'s really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn\'t have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward. And so that\'s just really where I\'m at and how I\'ve gotten here.","highlight_speakers":"David","tags":["public health.mental health"]},{"conversation_id":"1529","conversation_date":"2021-10-11","highlight_id":"4263502","highlight_start":"2578.1","highlight_end":"2684.3","highlight_words":"Growing up on Waldeck street, we had [inaudible] House, had a lot of programs that we used to use.

I did my best just to keep them occupied in any activity that I found, even though they were outside of Dorchester, because it was hard to find anything nearby for them. So I just searched someplace else out of [inaudible] and that shouldn\'t be the case. In fact, we should have more resources for the kids, more activities for them to be able to go and attend.

And I don\'t think any of the candidates really answered this well is how can we make housing more equitable for everyone in Boston? I\'ve been homeless twice, due to domestic violence. Actually right when the Long Island shelter was closed, right before the hundred inches of snow that we got that winter and I\'m grateful and privileged and blessed to have gotten housing after a few months of that. But I observed like when I go over to doctor\'s appointments over at BMC or being around methadone bile or mass and cast, as some people call it and the situation has gotten more out in the open and it makes me sad and just disappointed to see people not housed. I know that there\'s some small group that like to be outside because it\'s hard to be in a shelter, but I don\'t feel like the city is really doing enough. And I realized that it takes time to build housing, but I wish the city would make an even more stronger stance. And I don\'t mean just treatment, but having things like there\'s something called the housing first model where you don\'t put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, \\"You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we\'ll fill out your verification of homelessness form.\\" All these things that just make it that much harder. It\'s harder to be sober when you\'re out on the streets. And so, I feel if we had a more listed... I mean, I can\'t have all the solutions, it\'s complicated and we could spend literally a whole day talking about just this topic. So for me, I\'d like to see the homeless get more shelter and get housing and also to people who\'ve lived here for decades and have been here, I don\'t like seeing people pushed out to the suburbs, to other states.

And then more recently, my work is very focused on, housing and neighborhood planning work and know people\'s control of their own space. Yeah. I think struggle is... You can\'t eliminate struggle in the human experience and suffering, but struggle based on, to borrow from Bruce, because of how or where we were born into. Struggles as a result of all the things that divide us. What does a place look like where everybody can be? And by be, I don\'t mean like coexist without tension. I mean, where we can express ourselves fully and not be worried about getting food on the table and at whatever, whether you\'re fortunate enough to be, gainfully employed, have a career or wherever you are on the various spectrums of life, to feel whole and to have a rich spiritual and community life.

So I was raised here and I was also raised in the Bronx, but one thing I\'ve understood is, not all minorities are accepted in every neighborhood. We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don\'t really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce\'s ideal is why can\'t we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can\'t leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets. So as me, I\'m a Roxbury native. I could go as far as South End and feel included because there\'s many Latinos living there. But as a Roxbury native, when I was working in Cambridge, I felt excluded. I felt like I wasn\'t a part of that neighborhood, even though that neighborhood is, it\'s two cities in one. So it\'s very difficult to say or to view that. Okay, I\'m from Boston, I\'m from the bean, I\'m a Red Sox fan. I\'m the official patriarch. There\'s things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can\'t just all cross each other\'s regions. So my thing is when is it that it\'s going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I\'m accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it\'s very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they\'re putting in new housings, they\'re putting in new programs that doesn\'t really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub. So being the hub, that means we\'re bringing in different businesses from all over the world. So being that means we\'re bringing in different businesses from all over the world. And a couple years ago, we was known as the number one city in the country. So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city? Because we\'re the ones who make Boston real. We\'re the ones who make it, the way it is, the persona of being a Bostonian, is not these out of state people. That\'s my difficulty of understanding.

It's not safe on the road, the way these streets are weaving in and out, so I'm just wondering like what's going on. Are we getting pushed out? Because we aren't riding bikes. \"We\" are who? Us minorities aren't riding bikes to need the whole city to have bike lanes and bus lanes all around it. So, now we have bus lanes and the buses only come up the street every hour or so, so now traffic is congested for a bus that's going to come by every 40, 45 minutes. And now there's a whole lane that's restricted that cars can't commute down. I think it's stupid.",

I don't know if they're paying attention to what's happening in the other states, where the kids are coming down with all this extra variants and... It's not working. What is their plan to make it even better? I was in a meeting with the schools the other day, with parents asking, \"If you aren't giving me a billion-percent security that my child is not going to get COVID going back to this school, then I don't want it. I would like to go back to the remote model.\" And they just keep saying that we need to come to our electorals and tell them what we want. And I'm pretty sure there's been enough parents that have expressed their disapproval of this move, but what do they want? It's almost like those parents that want their kids in school, then go ahead and send your kids. But there should be an option for either remote or hybrid because, like you said, this pandemic isn't over. And now we have new variants and the virus changes and mutates, so it'd be best if parents had more of a say-so in these decisions.",

    "highlight_words": "I would just like to add a different perspective in terms of the parents having their kids in school versus the hybrid schedule. I don't have children in school at this point, but I do manage staff and a lot of my staff have younger kids at home. So, the expectations from the employer is they can give 100% to their 40 hours, but it's really unrealistic to ask them that if kids are required to stay home and things like that, so it's like a double-edged sword. So, I think it's a huge issue that they're going to have to, overall, really deal with. Personally, I think the hybrid isn't a bad thing because it's a happy medium. And we do have to function and move forward, but there are requirements in place for safety measures. So, again, there's just a lot of different folds in terms of people's concerns around going to school, staying home. I would not be on that committee. So, as far as me, in terms of my future, my question I had in regards to minorities being able to purchase in the city, this, for me, really hits home because I was blessed to have the opportunity to purchase a home in Roslindale probably five years ago. And I have a lot of friends that have really bussed there to save their money. Now that they're in a position with a decent amount of down payment, they've worked 99 jobs, guess what? They can't afford to buy here in Boston. So, to be going out, commuting back in for work, I think it's just unfair and there should be something in place where people can still afford to buy housing here within the city.",

They're saying they want to make sure everybody's vaccinated, but are they making sure that they continue the same safety protocols that they did in the beginning of this pandemic? Because, as a Fauci said and the different people of the... What is it called? [inaudible]. The CDC, this is going to be with us. And people are forgetting to wash their hands, use sanitizer, to just stay with them common practices that keep this virus at bay a little bit. And I just say, my concern is my children, because I know Boston. What makes them, all of a sudden, go and do something better within these school systems that's going to make it safe for the kids? That's what I don't trust. And they don't have a smaller amount of children. I think even they should probably go back to the certain days of the week so that all the kids- The hybrids. Yes. Yeah, because it's just too many kids in these schools. And when I was going to the schools, the schools were messed up. There was peeling paint, asbestos, no ventilation. What's the ventilation?

She was like, she's 48 and she was in elementary school so it was a long time ago. And my landlady who had bought the house for... It was a three family house we were living in, raise my rent from 700 to 1100 in one year and I had to move. And so, we moved to Jamaica Plain. And then several years later... I mean, I was real mad and angry, even though I was a leader of the Brookline Tenant Union, coordinated the entire towns' election and all the 20 precincts, and I just felt powerless and just left and contested. Anyway, a couple of years later, in '95 or '96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn't making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it. That apartment, it's your basic triple decker, tens of thousands of other triple deckers, not the whole building, just one floor, a thousand square feet, two bedrooms and a front room is now assessed by the city at about $500,000. I mean, that's crazy to me. So, how can anyone... I mean, I could never buy that house now, even though I make good money. And my daughter who moved to Phil... She's 48, bought a house in Philadelphia for 200 and something thousand dollars, could never, even though she makes a lot of money with her partner. So, that's my question. And that's my story. I mean, I was able to do it because I'm old, I'm 74, in '95/'96 I could buy this place with 72,000 and maybe by inflation, it might be 150 if normal inflation would take place, but it's 500. So, that's my question, how has anyone who's not a gazillionaire going to be able to live and stay in Boston. That's my story. And I'm sticking with it. And I'm done.",

Now, the problem is that Walsh, because of his ties to construction industry let developers take over this initiative and the developers, they're not so interested in quality of life issues or even in costs. Now they came up with this term called affordable housing, which is actually a developers term and what it amounts to is a slight reduction of rent for a year. Now, that's not really going to help a lot of people in the long run, but it provided the developers with an excuse who I erect here in my part of towns, literally hundreds of high rises, which is going to have a completely disastrous effect in terms of climate change issues in the near future, and the delivery of city services, including water and sewer, electric service is going to be deteriorated because every source has already said they don't want to provide more equipment. So we're facing a crisis of infrastructure mainly, and also a surging population that we can't possibly handle, because I mean, the rat situation here in this part of town is already out of control, as you know rats bring disease and cause other problems. So we're looking at, between one issue and the other, we're looking at it very large deficit in terms of quality of life in the near future. What can be done about it? Well I do have a solution, but nobody wants to hear it. Somebody, an entity or a group, needs to file a class action suit against the BPDA. Nobody wants to do that because they're a very powerful organization, but I don't see another solution. I spent all day with these groups online, discussing these issues, so I'm pretty well-informed, but we'll end up saying the same thing, \"We feel powerless to do anything about it.\" And this ties into what Michael was talking about also, and what Paul was talking about, and I think we're all talking around the same kinds of issues that Boston, it's not Paris, it's not London, it's not LA, we don't have that physical space here, which was an issue with the Olympics.

So, my personal experiences growing up in a dysfunctional society, in a family, I'm a survivor of molestation. I'm a survivor of the school to prison pipeline, which equal the fact that I was in the streets and I was gang involved which led me to stay in federal penitentiary beds. I'm a victim of an unjust criminal justice system, also. Today, I have close to a decade of sobriety, which includes a spiritual walk and foundation that I was talking about. With that, man, I'm a father of 10 and a grandfather of 10. And so, I don't put my trust in the government or politicians.

So, when I was able to get my first place and I did, I lived with someone but I couldn't live on my own because I wouldn't have been able to afford it, even though the rents were lower then. But once that relationship dissolved and I needed to have my own place, I couldn't afford one. I did not want to live in my parents' house, but I really had no choice because I couldn't afford rent though it was a lot lower than it is now, but now it would have totally been out of the question for me. So, my experience is rent has always been a challenge, but even more so where it seems to be gentrifying. Developers are coming in and they're putting more high-end in the city that we grew up and we love so it's unaffordable, unless you're making almost a triple digit salary.",

I think it's very important to touch base in the health programs too, more affordable health insurance, or again, like the low-income, middle-class family.

No father figure, no uncles, no older brothers. So no real great example of what a male should be and what males need to be doing. So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience. You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers. I think he was at UMass last, I don't know what's going on with brother Motley but that's what I'm saying. You still have brother Motley doing a lot of things throughout the city of Boston, and I can pick up the phone and call him. I have people like you from the Chica Project.

But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There's no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that's because of the racial difference and it's just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.",

I came here from Puerto Rico when I was three years old and I didn't know. I didn't know how to balance a checkbook. I didn't know what I didn't know, and no one showed me and I made a lot of mistakes financially. So now growing up, learning from my mistakes and a better place but right through a lot of bumps and hurdles, how do we teach our youth some of these things that other kids are taught from the beginning, so that they are in a better place to succeed. So when you talk about financial literacy, you're talking about balancing a checkbook, you're talking about your credit score, you're talking about saving money. All of these things that have an impact. You need these things in order to progress, in order to grow and in order to have some of these things that you want in life. So, what is Boston preparing? What are they going to do?",

I initially approached this film more like, okay it's a political film, but my strength is making personal films. So now I'm looking at Boston personally, because, even though I'm from New York City, I feel like Boston is the city that can set an example for the rest of the United States. Racism is throughout the United States. I'm an advocate for education and it's a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you're in Boston and I'm hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there's no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.",

    "highlight_words": "why are our schools in Boston still segregated in terms of I guess race? In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",

And I'm like, no, I graduated from BPS system, I feel a little bit offended because I went to a BPS school and I turned out fine. And I feel like I'm a good contribution to the world. So I want other students to also feel that same thing once they graduate. I understand, not to say I definitely don't agree, but I understand where some of the stuff is coming from based off of just how BPS is run and how certain things, and I'm not trying to like downplay BPS like it's a bad organization, but we definitely have a lot of work to do and I just think that that was my experience of, why not be BPS. Why can't somebody from BPS go to Harvard. Don't downplay BPS, don't downplay the students in BPS. They have so much potential just like students that are in different parts of Massachusetts, whether they're in the suburbs, whether they're in the city, they definitely are capable of the same thing.

Basically, coming home one night after being out with some friends, spending money, having a good time and coming across some teenagers or just sitting out on the sidewalk, no home, nowhere to turn to, no shelter and they needed food. And I thought to myself, \"I've spent all this money to have myself a good time,\" and a couple of my friends were basically saying, \"They're just trying to hustle you. They're just ...\" This, that and the other. It touched my heart because I ended up ... One girl started crying because she wasn't from Massachusetts. She had been brought here by someone else. I really didn't know what to do except to actually go and get them some food and sit there on the sidewalk with them and just listen to them. And basically, at that point, that's what they needed, just somebody to listen and really believe. They needed some help. Eventually, I had to leave them because at that point, at that time, I didn't know who to get in touch with to help them. And that broke my heart, that I couldn't do anything for them. But I was able to feed them and sit and have a conversation for a couple of hours and left my friends and let them go on. So that saddens me. The homelessness has gotten worse.

Those experiences are almost even more important than the whole education, 12 years or 14 years or whatever of their education. So that's my story.",

At the age of nine, I remember vividly going to Cub Scout every Wednesday, being spit on by white boys, drunken white boys who were bigger than me ... I was nine years old ... teenage white boys. And they would spit on me, drunk, and I would have to go into Cub Scout smelling of liquor and spit. I can still smell the liquor. One of the opening songs we were saying is my country ... Or recite, \"My country, 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty,\" but I didn't feel very free. Fast forward, as the executive director of the community center I used to go to as a child, as the assistant director going into the director, I was initiated with the child steward tragedy in 1989 in October. I can remember the date and time, seeing black men being strip-searched, civil rights savagely violated. I'm being the director and I had to turn around because I didn't want to be subjected to it. These were my friends. These were my participants in the community center, people that grew up with me, family members. Actually, my cousin, who was a former city councilor, was one of the kids. I skipped over something very important because I know that education is pointing ... And this has been in the news. One of the most prominent high schools in the city of Boston throughout the country, the first public school ... In the seventh grade, I was accepted in Boston Latin. I did not want to go there, but my mother made me go there. But during my tenure there in the seventh grade, I was called the N-word by a teacher. So I continued to fight for the freedom, the liberation of black boys and black men. I have a 21-year-old son. Every time I look at the news, I'm afraid of the young people I've helped, the brothers I see. When I opened up, I said I'm emotionally, spiritually in that zone, trying to deal with life. I lost a friend, I'm speaking at his funeral tomorrow, who happens to be connected to an elected official, our mayor. I fought to help black men with an effort to form a commission that was denied.

It marginalized people of color, it marginalized women, marginalized LGBTQ, all that youth. And I think education is a source of all opportunity and all growth and all wealth. So I speak from my experience, because I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with Arne Duncan, who is the former Secretary of Education. And this was a meeting where students from all across the country, we sat down, we talked with him. And we just got to talk, what is our education system looking like? And I'm from Boston, Harvard's down the sheet, Wentworth, MIT, all these schools. But in my mind, and I'm actually talking with the kids that I work with now, they're juniors and seniors [inaudible] O' Bryant School. And they're like, they read these books that like, \"The next day, we don't remember what we read.\" And it's interesting because I think that when I actually talked with Arnie Duncan, I told him straight up, I was like, \"You look like you're really outstanding man. So why is it that we don't have classes on financing? Why can't we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden? How to cook for yourself? How to buy a car? How to do these things? Why does our family members have to do this on our own and teach and teach us when.\" I feel it makes sense in education system, we should be learning that specific fact. I mean, the weather cycle is great and all, but teach the foundations of life first and then you can proceed to electives as in like, language and... I mean, language is of course important but teach stuff on first. And it's interesting because I think that that's something education is once we're going to do it, you have to be a public school, or a private school, or a charter school to start your own curriculum. But I think that it's important to start teaching, especially Black and Brown youth, we shouldn't wait until you're in your 20s to start learning about finance. And it's unfortunate that these kids we had to learn on our own, how to do all of it. It's just not right.",

And I feel we see a lot of buildings and affordable housing units and all these things being pop up, but the demand for is still not being met. So my personal experience is I entered the lottery for one of these new buildings, and the lotteries through the city, but then once you get accepted, it then gets pushed to the property management company. And the property management companies have tactics in place to deter folks from actually being placed within those units. So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that's being funded by the taxpayers, that's being built by the city, and all these different things, and it's just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately. And in a space where there's a lot of just disorganization, and they're not being honest about things. And they're saying, \"Oh, this person's rejecting it, and not creating a full picture.\" We're never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you're not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there's just no accountability period for anyone. Folks just get to do what they want to do, they put a really great picture on, they write eloquent words, they create this whole pie chart and graphs without actually implementing any other measures or showing all the progress that was made. And no one goes back and says, \"Well, we know we want to be able to audit your paperwork, we want to be able to see what it is that you're doing. We want to have conversations with folks that you've had contact with to understand what customer service has been? What process has there been? Has it been transparent? What's happening? And so as we're working to build more spaces and build more housing for folks, I would really love to see this city or the next mayor really have a handle on what is actually happening. And I know that the mayor, she or he cannot do everything by themselves, but they also have to make sure that the folks that they're appointing around them has the capacity and the ability to really go forth and prioritize this.",

Affordable housing means to me, me now working two jobs to pay my rent, me spending time with my child instead of always at work. And then on Saturday, I'm cramming all this quality time with my child. So that's basically what I did. There was no community and what happened to the affordable community centers, right? So and then, growing up, I grew up with my son. And basically, I had to work two jobs, just to maintain, to make sure that he... I was a single mom, make sure he was able to go into programs and go to community centers and stuff like that. But I got to work in order for him to do that. You know what I mean? And the centers wasn't cheap. The program wasn't cheap. And me, because I couldn't afford education, [inaudible] had the money for it, my years and... So there's another question, education versus years and your position. If I got the experience, years of experience, but I don't have the education, when does that going to count again? Just because somebody was able to afford a education doesn't mean that they have knowledge and understanding or understand the population that they're dealing with. So I couldn't get those high paying jobs, because didn't had a education, but I had the experience, you know what I mean? So it goes all the way back to the affordable housing, I would be content, if I didn't have to raise my child and make sure he was equipped. If I didn't have to work two jobs, it's hard trying to juggle school work and your child, you know what I mean? So, I think we need to bring back affordable housing which is really affordable to middle class people, working people because when you are working, in my experience, you can't get certain benefits, you can't get TAFDC, you can't get food stamps, snap as you all call it benefits anymore, because you are overqualified. You have to qualify first before you can get this snap. And so stuff like that helps and it benefits your child. But the working class, if we make over a certain amount, we can get that affordable housing, quote, unquote, we can get the support that other families can get. And people that, basically, I'm not going to say we don't need it. But what I'm saying is, we all need it. We all need support. We all need a hand. So, don't look at my income and say that it's less than somebody else that has lower income. My needs is the same as that other person. So if my needs are not being met, right? How can I afford it? So their needs is not being met by this programming to help them meet those needs. But there's no programming for us middle class. So my question is, when are we going to have affordable housing? So women, single moms don't have to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet.",

Why can't we get properties? So that is my question. When is that going to change? How is it going to change? Who is going to work with us as a community to make that change? We say affordable housing, yes, I agree that yes, we need affordable housing, but what about affordable homes? What about banks lending us money? So that's my question. And I remember when I was younger, going to a bank to borrow money, it was ludicrous. Impossible. So now we're still in this fight of getting money from the banks. So, Who? When? I want to see my future. I have a son, who's in his... Will be 40. It's even hard for him right now. I have a 10 year old grandson. When?

And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system. And so as an experiment, I thought that this is a skewed experiment because what you're doing is that you're loading the experimental school. If you're really trying to understand what could be a more advantageous school system or whatever, and you put it with folks who, in a lot of way anybody whose kid was doing well in the traditional system wouldn't take them out and put them in an experiment. So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results. When I see that happening again, I see the same ideas about trying to open up the classroom and trying to not have grades and trying to design schools that try to meet the students where they are and just going through the same cycle.

She almost single handedly got the T station near her house to be completely renovated, and prioritized, and made accessible. I was visiting her, and she offered me a cup of tea in her apartment. I took her up on it, and she was like, \"Great, and you're going to have to make the tea, because I can't get into my kitchen, because it's not wide enough for my wheelchair.\" When halfway through our visit I asked if I could use the bathroom, and she was like, \"Yeah, I'll stay over here, because they had to take the door off, because I couldn't get my wheelchair into the bathroom with the door on.\" This is an apartment that she found after looking for at least a year, and this is the best she could get. It just feels so hard, I think the sense of it being so temporary living here, and if you can get in the door in the first place.",

They're just trying to figure out how the cheap, the place they have, where they're at. That's my thing. A lot of folks are like, \"How can folks afford to live?\" Many folks that I'm encountering are trying to figure out how they can just stay where they're at. A lot of the folks that I'm encountering are living in places that are known to many folks as what we call projects today. Housing developments that were never for people to actually live in for long periods of time. The projects are made for military families that were going to get the G.I. Bill that's going to elevate them to housing. What happened was, it was not distributed people. So a lot of families were families of color were not provided with the G.I. Bills, and they were left behind in the projects. For three or four generations you had people that have been in these little small spaces. I myself now I'm a resident of a small space that I'm speaking of. That happened due to the gore circumstances of life. I'm not complaining, trust me, grateful.

Maybe they were sponsored by their government, and they were well-trained. But I worked with them in computer schools, and a lot of them, they have a lot of skills. Yeah, I say to myself, thinking that if I can put together a computer network, physical computer network, and have a nonprofit organization, I might invite in US citizens that are striving to develop their skills in the IT department, and come in and work at it to try to gain those skills, because the knowledge they're getting in colleges, like the community college, I guess isn't enough. You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay. Okay. So, like that, the same way it is with IT. You look at a few computers, but the computers are... You cannot put them together or take them apart completely. They stare. You do a couple of things, and voila. You know, you're not... Yeah. Okay. So, you have... Okay. All right. So, I get it.

You cannot successfully hold together a society without a thriving middle class, and the middle class is shrinking, is disappearing in places like Boston, and New York, and San Francisco. Disappearing in places like London and Paris. Disappearing. So, that's my question. What kind of jobs are going to be around to pay more?

The minimum wage was like $2.50 an hour. I was marketing like $5.50 an hour. I mean, if I had kept on that wage, I'd probably be making $85,000 a year now. But the unions are gone.

When I mention Rochester, a lot of people think New York, but it's by New Bedford, so I'll just mention New Bedford, to dial it in. And they're doing produce, so they're doing a great job doing produce, but they're not making the amount of money that they need to make. Cause number one, they're not getting the capital that they deserve. Minority people of color not receiving the capital, now if that's something you want to dial into, we can dial into that also. A lot of us don't even know the resources that we do have available, and those resources that we do have available, they're not willing to give us exactly what we need, as opposed to other races. With that being said, we have to cut a lot of our costs, and when we cut a lot of our costs, we really can't, because we have to hold on to every single penny that we do have. So we have to get into the cannabis industry. But like I said, that ended up being the good thing at this point in time. But that does affect the entirety of our way of living, our way of getting back and forth to work, and it's a good drive to go out there to the agriculture land, but once again, it affects not only ... Just our every day way of life. I'm trying to dial it in as much as I possibly can, without giving you exact numbers.",

My question is, how will the city's educational system help preserve the history and the historical landmarks of the people in the neighborhoods, also, their legacy be preserved and celebrated. How do we use this to educate people about our people and their values? I think this leads to having more ownership and more say in what we do in our communities. I think there are important folks, important leaders, people who don't have enough voice, I would say, or enough ownership with what they're doing and how they're creating community and leading. So my question is really, how do we start to preserve the legacy and educate people in the educational system as well, but also start to educate people in the neighborhoods about the values and the landmarks, so that we could have more control over what we do. And more vision about what we want to see next, with the people who've built it for us.",

And when I was growing up in Boston, we just had a lot more of integrity about our space, and principal about who we were and where we came from. I always learned to respect my elders, and always look out for other people who come before me, so those are the people who I work with it or I try to learn from now. And I feel like that stuff is getting erased. Not a lot of students that I teach now, they know nothing about their leaders. There's not enough of us out there becoming young leaders for the youth, so it's about really painting a bigger picture for the future. I know this because I'm in Upham's Corner community, and I feel like a lot of the people who I feel are leaders, are not represented enough to be able to carry through with their legacy, and with the moves that they want to make, because we don't have a place where the vision is held, like archived of all this stuff. Where we can say, \"This is proven to be done and we need these people back again.\" I just think that there should be more say. A lot of people should have a better say, more voice around what they want to see in their community. But we have to preserve the legacy and also bring that back into the educational system, which will hopefully amplify the historical landmarks that we have, so they can't be erased. I want to advocate for that more. I think there's a lot of neighborhood legacy. I want to advocate for that, just try to make that something before it just disappears, and it's not the same anymore. Create a better community by educate with the youth too, about where they're at, because the community is special too. And I feel like a lot of us don't know, because we're not walking outside enough, or talking to our neighbors enough and stuff. Doing that just makes you feel like you belong in the community, and we need to keep that feeling, instead of having it feel like there's no community, or it doesn't feel like the same community.",

Because my mother's a home owner and her parents are home owners, I saw how it goes, I saw how I could get there, but that map, I guess it wasn't inclusive of everybody. I had a friend and my friend was renting. He goes, \"We had to move from this place that was $900 a month for three bedrooms, and now we're in Roxbury, paying 1700 for a two bedroom, and he wants to go up in two months to 1900.\" I had to kind of sit him down. He's older than me, and I had to say to him, \"Dude, what you're paying for rent, I'm paying for mortgage. You and your people have enough money to have a mortgage.\" It was kind of a hard conversation to have, because he's kind of looking at me and I just never realized, I never talked about mortgage and ... I guess we're friends, but I never had the conversation about, \"You can do this too,\" and I probably could have had it 10 years ago, but I'm just thinking he knew what I knew, and he didn't know what I know. And he was looking at me and I'm like, \"We're paying the same money.\" And then when he realized it, it took him a year, and his mother yelled at me because I was talking about, \"If your mother has a job, she has a 401k, you make enough money, you can put it together.\" And then you see the mother now, happy in the house like ...

I've had a ton of career just roadblocks because I'm a woman or because I'm Asian or because there's a misunderstanding about my level of education or knowledge. So there's all of these little roadblocks within individual experience that we don't address and when you keep telling people that you work hard, you'll get there. But it really depends on what industry you're in. When I worked in tech, it was insane to me that they were paying me so much just for an assistant level position whereas when I was doing something that I loved in design, I was making less than all of my peers. So no matter how hard I worked or how much further along, I move through moved up in whatever industry is like that, trying to close that gap was an uphill battle. It makes me frustrated, because it's not a lack of trying hard that people are struggling, it's not because people are lazy or because they're not educated. I know plenty of people who work in Starbucks and they have a PhD. So it really how do we want to address it because people do want to work and they do want to contribute and have legacy and have impact, but there are so many gatekeepers.

All of these great, like high-end resources that are attracting outside talent, when there's also that talent within Boston. I think there needs to be more of an effort to provide those resources to people who are from Boston and willing to put in the work, because there are students in Boston Public Schools, in the Boston Metro Area that are willing to do that. But living in Boston just isn't an option because of the cost of actually living in the city and being close to those amenities outside of living with family or friends.

So we have a lot of failures at interest rate or the transition part between high school and college. Seeing those, it's kind of weird to me. And expression in terms of like arts. That's just an example. But thinking of Latin Quarters in Jamaica Plain and thinking of Nubian station. Nubian Square, seeing how those aren't just titles, but it does represent something and it does express something culturally. So I do understand that that is powerful, especially fighting against things like gentrification. So I'm wondering what that would look like. And the other one was real inclusion in policymaking. So just being at different community meetings. One, specifically in South End, I don't want to go too much in detail, but just seeing how developers and just leaders of the communities and seeing how they can... It seems like the actual people live in the communities are actually marginalized, even within the community meeting. So a lot of things that are important to them that they collectively think are important, it seems like it's not paid attention to these policies happening, these things happening, they get moved out. And people think that the community isn't saying anything, but the community is but nobody's listening.",

And so I can only imagine the students and youth who do find themselves in that position, where they're unable to afford going to college or whatever their post-secondary planning is. I have family members who are undocumented and friends who I know who are undocumented, yet they've lived in the United States for so long, but there is no reform towards helping them to get from wherever they are to a pathway to citizenship, despite living in the US for so long. So really understanding what the reform is present. And again, like this is bigger than Boston, it's definitely on a national scale, where there's just a lot of loopholes that people have to jump through in order to just prove that they deserve to be in the country or prove that they deserve a citizenship, whatever that might be.

You're going to do what you want to do.\" And he blatantly said in front of city officials, O&S, \"Yes, we already made this deal. We're going to go forward anyway.\" As blatant as that. I said, \"So why bother coming to our meeting? What was the purpose?\" So how do I make sure that our voices are being heard or my voice?

People who are making these decisions each and every single day, but, they don't hear from the youth, right, and the youth just know when the decisions are made and they are already implemented? They don't get a, hey, we're working on this. Hey, what is your opinion? So, in a little bit of detail from me more in an example to elaborate is, I was appointed by the mayor to serve on the search committee for the superintendent of Boston Public Schools. That was something that a lot of people within our governmental stand were not proud of. They didn't want to talk and they didn't want to see it happen. But I find this so fundamentally important and I think I made a stand and I left a mark that a lot of people now think of it as something that we need, right? So now it's a staple. Now we want to make it a staple that each time we made these certain decisions we have students there, because adults were finally able to see the importance of having a youth voice in these major decision meetings at these hiring places, because at the end of the day we're hiring those people to serve the youth and we're hiring them to buy them either a better education or a better lifestyle, because at the end of the day they are the ones who are getting affected by these decisions.

I won't say I've never had a racist experience in my entire life here, I definitely have, but I haven't had it for the degree that I feel the reputation Boston has. I haven't had racist experiences to that degree, and I'm not saying they haven't happened for other people who may live here, but I haven't had those experience. And so I do make space for folks who may have though. But I travel a lot and I hear it often like, \"Oh, you from Boston.\" I actually had some people ask me, \"Are there black people in Boston?\" This was many years ago, but it was like, wow! And in fact it was a person from, it was either South Dakota or North Dakota. And I'm like, \"How are you going to ask me a question like that when you're from North Dakota or South Dakota. Aren't there black people there?\" So, as ignorant as that may sound, but my point being is, I travel a lot and I often hear folks who have issue with Boston and some [inaudible] that question around me once we get past the sports is usually going to be around some form of the racist question that they're going to ask me, like my experience with racism in living in Boston, and makes me feel like Massachusetts is the furthest northern confederate state of some sort.

And it's just being exposed. There's a lot of things around that. 14 deaths and they want to shut down. People, family members are protesting every day because they're saying that their loved ones are not safe. And I could find out, but I don't know at this point how many were women, but I think the majority of them were women. And so, because of that, that really hits home. And who is responsible for this? A governor is running this state of Massachusetts. And there's been nothing said in terms of, we're bringing it to his attention and he has commented on this situation. So that's one of my questions. How do we make our neighborhood safer? That's the other thing that comes to mind with me is, are we doing all that we can with our youth, because it's not just in one area, it's in the whole sector of the city. If you who listen to the reports over the Summer, with young crime at hand, and I've been in this city a long time ago and it has never been this high and it doesn't seem like it's changing. I haven't given up on our city and I don't think that anybody in higher position should give up either. We have got to do better. We have got to do more with our youth. I know we just went through a pandemic which is another whole issue, but as I looked, as I search, I just don't think there are enough programs for our youth. We don't have enough programs. We don't have enough involvement. And we don't have enough involvement in terms of policing. We don't have enough of them being able out in the community, in the schools talking so that people don't feel like policing is just about pulling you over, pulling out a gun, you know what I mean? Being afraid for your life. We're all very uncomfortable in this. It's how are we going to make it better? What do we need to do to make this better?",

I went on probably like one field trip, a basketball game in my four years of high school there. So yeah, I just want to know what's up with that? Why are some schools getting more money than others? And how can we make it a more equal playing field to ensure that everyone gets a good high school experience, because I personally feel that mine wasn't as good.

But it would be small little things like that around the school. And I also feel like that affected some of the teachers that work there too because they're coming into work every day, they see all these things missing, broken school supplies, things like that, that kills your motivation to want to be a good teacher.

But everyone is just like, \"Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood.\" And I think people don't think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston. And I think a lot of people have concerns about going to different neighborhoods, just because of what they think that neighborhood is, or what each neighborhood could be like. And especially coming from abroad, everyone's tells you not to go to a certain neighborhood within Boston, or they just say, \"Oh, all this neighborhood is just the same way.\" Which is definitely not true. So I think my experience is just, I believe although it should be within, I guess, the authority of the City of Boston in general to help.

Because we have a toddler, and we'll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don't want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices. So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you're dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you'll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston.

And I say for the housing and those new buildings they're doing, we want to live in one of them, but, what? We can't afford it. Look at the rent. That's for high-class people, that's not for low-class people like us. Come on that's for high-class people, we don't need that.

Even though there's a lot of minorities running business in the City of Boston they're not really running their business correctly because we haven't really been taught how to run a business. We're probably going to be wearing more than one hat at one time when we're trying to run our business. We don't have the accountants, we don't have the bookkeepers. Maintaining the employees- Karen, are you a business owner? Yes. Okay. I am certified with the City of Boston, and that process is a process that not many people of color can qualify for. We need a hand up, not a handout more times than others or more than others do. It's just a lot for us to deal with. We need probably to structure it a little bit differently, the opportunities that are out there a little bit different for some of the minority business owners than just putting everybody in the same hat, you know what I'm saying, if that makes sense.",

In addition to that if there was a situation, well there will be a situation. It's just a matter of time. They say what does that evacuation look like? Where is that discussion at because that's really important for people that live in the community that don't know? I know there were some evacuation signs, but I was told there really wasn't ... And the other thing is the tyranny that goes along with we voted for cannabis and consumption, and the stigmatization that went along with people who did smoke cannabis. And then you have these judges that lock up a lot of cannabis users. And now some of these judges, I wouldn't say all of them, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're not in the cannabis industry. Those judges that sent these young, and I say black and brown and Latino people to jail including my loved one. My family was incarcerated because they were an addict and they used drugs to provide for their addiction. What about crime? But they still did jail time unlike the addicts of today that they want to find them injection centers. They're not injection centers but there are places where they can go and indulge in the activity of their choice. They want to provide shelters for these addicts of today. They want to put them on Front Street in the prime areas where there's business owners. There's a black hotel down there. We won't even know that it's a black hotel. When it was open, we did very much go over there and have a great time, but now with the drug addiction people that are surrounding those areas who's helping those business owners to get back to the level where they deserve to get the revenue that they deserve. But because of the eyesore like where's that conversation at. And the consumerism, we can go into the cigar bars and you can go into the bars and you can do hookah, and you can do cigars. You can't do cannabis, but we voted for that, like you owe us that. There's tyranny there. And who's talking about that? It's not okay. It's just not okay. And then I know there's a whole 2030 Boston blueprint and what it's supposed to look like, the metropolis that they're building around us. We don't see that in the urban community unless you go down to City Hall and you're aware of ... We'll just go over all of it. If you're aware of the protocol that they have for that. And the last thing is Nathaniel Holland Fenway Park. Those parks are for the people, but the people can't use them. In other words, there was just a write-up in the Globe that Fenway had never had lined the Urban Act in the whole history of the Fenway Park. I have never, ever wanted to say, \"Hey son, let's go to Fenway Park for an hour.\" Never, and I take my kids on a lot of outings. And the other thing is the youth center, when I played football and one of the things I always was very happy about in all the years that I played with my children is when we go to those games the people who support them always had a banner, so we knew who the business owners that support our children. In Northeast, I never had one. And I'll end it with that.",

And the credit score and everything was changing where I did have a decent credit score, but everything was changing. There was a lull for like two or three years where it didn't seem like anyone could buy anything. You know what I'm saying? With the whole watching ... Like I said, with watching housing change where there were housing being sold, three family homes, like I live in Dorchester. For instance, living here in Dorchester versus someone who may live in Roxbury where they started talking about the word regentrification. To be on this side of how everyone had to highlight on Roxbury, I'm one of the people who living here in this community would say that Dorchester is being regentrified, and no one was paying attention to that because like I said the three family homes were being sold, but they're being sold and they're being turned into condos, and how do you turn a three family home and all of a sudden start saying that these are condo floors, and each floor now costs $360,000 versus a home, that whole home would run you $500,000. You know what I'm saying? I personally witnessed that. That's where my question comes from with the formula in pricing based of ... Where I think the housing crash happened, it took away, I think, the American dream of a hard working person owning a home and being able to own a home and say possibly use one of their floors to be their small business or like I said a second income. That's what I've seen with the what happened to housing since 2008, and the way that is continuing. That's a part of the whole plan of where she says the whole plan of before was what was Boston going to look like in 2020, and now the whole vision is 2030, and just that part like where is rent going to go from here if an average three bedroom apartment if you can get it to say apartment and not condo is running like $2,200, $2,300 and more. There's something a lot of people who have decent jobs that work for the T, that work for the police, I work for the city, one of the city department divisions, and that's astronomical to be asking somebody to spend $2,000 a month. I've been fortunate to be in a situation where my family does own properties, and realistically for what has gone on like I said with the whole housing situation, I don't even seen my three family home being something that I want to stay.",

There were 12 families in the Maverick projects at the time in the late '60s and '70s when I moved there. As a child when the white boys, white girls busting our windows out I'm looking out the window peeking. And we'd call the cops. They'd come, do nothing, absolutely nothing. So as a little girl watching this, my mom walking around the house with a football helmet because bricks was coming through the windows. It got so back the Black Panthers actually came to Maverick projects to help us, to assist us because the cops never ever did anything for us. So my whole life I've endured this kind of racism on the police force, as a parent living in the projects in South Street watching my son and his friends being harassed constantly by the police. And there's never ever, in my opinion, my own experiences, there's never ever been anything but racism that I've seen. And then I think about the black cops. When are you going to show up for us? You're sitting in the cruisers with these folks. I was arrested for trying to defend my son in my home. Called them to my home. I'm in the back of a cruiser, and the white boy, because that's what they are to me, says to me, \"What do you do for a living?\" As he's transporting me to the jail, and I said, \"None of your business.\" And his response to that was, \"Probably nothing. You're just like the rest of them collecting a check.\" [inaudible]. That's what we endure. And at this age, 61 years old still enduring that kind of racism in the police force, so what is going to be done? Who's going to help us? We need some assistance with these folks that are supposed to protect and serve. I think it's just generational racism. Who are they now? The white boys that were busting my windows out, who are they now? Where are they now? Are they teaching my grandchildren with that racist spirit? Is this why our kids can't learn because you talk about generational wealth, what about generational racism? That's what I've endured. That's my question, when is there going to be some police reform and something has to be done about this racism on the force. When are they going to see us as people and human like the rest of them? When are they going to recognize that we need to be protected and served as well?",

There's a lot of walks and different things for breast cancer and different things like that, but there's no things that minorities know about or feel comfortable participating in. And I think that if there was more preventative healthcare minorities would probably live longer because there's a lot of health issues that are hereditary things that are killing black men and women, but also I think that it's hard to get good healthcare in Boston if you don't have the right health insurance.

So your father have been carrying on pretty good fight. Remember when he ran for mayor and you would think all the hard work he had put out things would be better. So you wouldn't be having this discussion, but here we are, I mean the same discussion. So my personal opinion is that I think you get to a point where it wears you down and makes you feel hopeless. I think what we probably need is some hope, a breath of fresh air. One of the things someone comment on, is the voting and everyone concentrate on the presidential vote. I think, I'm not speaking for him, but I think in my mind, when Obama was running, we were hopeful. \"Wow, things are getting better.\" And I think that's what we need in our community right here in Boston. We don't see things are getting better. We're not feeling it. So, we're kind of in the dumps a little bit. So I think we need a rare hope.",

Massachusetts had the first Black senator ever elected, the second Black governor ever elected. And during this time where the plight of people of color are elevated and they had three strong candidates on the ballot, none of them made it through. To me, that felt like... that was a blow. I was like, that was crazy to me. I couldn't even fathom that, especially when I looked at around, at one point in time, I think last year, maybe even this year, Boston had a Black district attorney, Black sheriff, Black chief... I mean commissioner, excuse me. But basically had Blacks in every level of law enforcement at the highest level. I don't know. And I'm thinking like, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? That's why I checked in like intellectual. Because to me, that's something... I think this was the best chance ever to have a Black man and it never happened. I know that I've been in Massachusetts a long time and I've known somebody become the mayor, they're there till they die, they leave, or they go somewhere else.

I made a decision at that point that I would treat them like people, and collect them, and listen to them, even if I was totally unprepared, especially since part of what I wanted to do and part of the reason why I was running was addressing house instability and ultimately a path to ownership for everybody, including formerly homeless and low-income people. I mean, that was like, I would be a hypocrite if I didn't. There would be no reason to run if I didn't actually took time to listen, that kind of thing. I was amazed. I mean, some were initially skeptical, but a lot of them were appreciative that I was willing to ask for the signature and take time to listen to them, even though, for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the addresses don't get updated in the city, a lot of the signatures probably wouldn't count, but I thought the right thing to do was to listen and do that kind of thing. That made me realize, you know, and it was apparent from conversations that a lot of people did not take the time and did not take time to engage people in that kind of situation that way. I was like, okay, maybe there should be a way to engage them when it's not in those kind of accidental, although not in a bad way, circumstances.",

    "highlight_words": "my story is, my family has been here about 55 years, but back when I was born, there was the problem with desegregation, and I was shipped to Cambridge, where I matriculated for the first six years of my life. Then I left Cambridge and I went to... I had the advantage of public education, then I went into a private situation, and I was there for about three years. And then I left and went to another private situation because my parents were adamant they were going to keep me out of Boston. Then my children were born. I have twins, a daughter and a son. My son is somewhat challenged, so he was in special education. I lived in a town that I don't want to name right now, but to make a long story short, I had a fire. My house burned, and they kicked me son out of school three times. I had to get an education attorney, and I had to, because as long as we stayed homeless, he had stay-put rights, so I stayed homeless. In my car and families' houses, and the whole nine. That's my next book. To keep my son in his special education program, because he was in middle school, and it was a pivotal time. I did not want him in Boston, however the town had a detective following us around. And the detective came to the hearing at the Department of Education and gave sworn testimony, which was a lie, a humongous lie, and so we lost our case. He got kicked out of the town, and ended up in Boston. Then I had to eat that, because Boston kept him back, and I wasn't happy with that. So yes, I have a story, I have some wounds, and I would like to know that for the future, education is going to be better. I think trades need to brought back, everybody can't handle college. College isn't the answer like we've been duped to believe. It's gotten us debt, so that's my contribution. I would like to know and think that the future generations are going to have a better education, better opportunity, for public educational, in a non-traditional way, and cost effective.",

At one point, five degrees, which is what most people are anticipating is the very baseline of what's going to happen, it's like two times as tall as me.

In both Somerville, most recently, but also in San Francisco, where I'm originally from, I have just seen... Some people, I think, might call it gentrification, but what I actually experienced is just the flavor going away. I mean, actually, quite literally, flavor. My mom grew up in the Mission District in San Francisco, which is heavily Latin X, heavily Mexican, and bit by bit, the places that we used to go for things, certain foods, my favorite burrito place, my favorite spot for different desserts and things like, that's gone. It literally just disappears, and so [inaudible]... That's just one example, in San Francisco. I would say the same thing about Somerville. I lived, for some time, outside of Union Square. And it used to be that I could walk into the Brazilian markets down there, there's a Korean market down there, there's a bunch of Indian spaces down there, literally spliced. Different kinds of flavor, and you could walk into these spaces and get that kind of flavor, that kind of culture, that kind of... All those things that come along with food. And you could walk in there... I've actually recently visited, and it's not the same. It's not that kind of thing that it used to be, when I lived out there for 12 years. And I'm starting to see that in Boston as well. I'm starting to see, I think, on a negative front, a lot of places getting pushed out farther and farther. You're starting to see places go into Malden and Quincy, and that's cool. I'm glad that places are still existing, but those places, some of them used to be in Boston. On the more positive front, I'm also starting to see some new spaces coming up, like 50 Kitchen, in Dorchester, that's a pretty awesome spot. There's a couple real cool spots out in... I mentioned Somerville, but I know my friend Elliot has a restaurant called Tanam, that's out near Bow Street Market, so there's these little gems that I'm starting to see, but not as fast as these other places are going away. So my question is really about, how do we keep those old pieces that I... I loved visiting those markets. I loved going to those spots, and in the Mission District in San Francisco, and I also like some of these new spots. And so I'm like, \"How do we keep that\"?

So we've got to start out with the children first, which is where I'd like to start. Get that. And then, like I said, with food, the prices are so high now. Gee, how we going to eat?",

And for that, for myself, I've never been diagnosed with it, but I know firsthand just by looking all around that our people need help. Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me.

When folks decide, \"Oh yeah, this is what we need. This is where we need to be.\" Then the question becomes, \"Okay, so how do we rewrite the story and get these folks out of the way, so that we can have our ultra-luxury city?\" You nailed it. And I think the thing that does bring some, I think joy and a bit of solace to me is the fact that I believe people learned a very valuable lesson from the South End and people being bought out and literally having property stole from under them, because the reality is, we don't see the blueprints, 40 years, 20 years, 10 years out. So we don't know where it's going. So, you think you're are getting a good deal when low and behold, it comes back and it becomes luxury property. So I am very thankful knowing that to some extent, I think that we've learned from that, to the extent that we can do something about it. It's a whole other story, but we've got young, progressive, savvy, young folks in our community now who are saying, \"No, this is my home. I'm staying, and this is how I'm going to shore this up.\" So it's important to me, I think looking at that and then figuring out my role in maintaining, sustaining, making certain that my young people are well equipped with, first and foremost, their history. They need to know what goes on, what happens, how things happen, how they transpire, and then I want to do my part to help to equip them and give them a head-start on protecting or creating.

A big theme that popped up for the teens I worked with this summer was dealing with family dynamics and oftentimes not feeling safe or heard in their own homes. And how can we provide resources for them to work through that? So for me, I'm really just thinking about, how can we create safe spaces for young people, teenagers, middle schoolers, high schoolers, to talk about what they're going through and then to get the help they need to deal with whatever it is that they're going through?

With Healthy Boston, a developed program that was called Ties that Bind. What the purpose of that was, was to bring an intergenerational component to children that were latchkey, what have you. And we did things like put together whale-watch trips, going to the theater. We got donations from the different museums and things of that nature. Keep the children engaged, but also give them some guidance by participating in these different events with the older generation. But we've lost all those. Those were very successful programs. But I would say, if you want to see what was then back in the late eighties, early nineties and stuff, or what have you, This Ain't Normal would be a good show to watch.

And I was born and grew up in the heart of the civil rights era. So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street. We used to know all of our neighbors. So when you talk about the kids having things to do and places to go, that wasn't so much an issue because all of our households had a hand in making that happen for kids. I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I'll do stuff for them, I'll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them. But they see me and they go, \"Hi neighbor.\" That's our life now. It used to be that we knew them, they knew us. We knew about each other. We knew how to help each other. It was more than just a casual wave to someone, \"Hey, how you're doing?\" So, that's missing. So now I think that in our community conversations... I think much like this call, it needs to be intergenerational. It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shamika and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who's at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we're not there, we get them there. And if we need to, we need to build another table that's big enough to accommodate everybody so that we can all be a part of the conversation.",

And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\" And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, \"Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens.\" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, \"Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success.\" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward. And so that's just really where I'm at and how I've gotten here.",

As opposed to trying to pick up that piece of paper or look in someone's face and smile and say something pleasant. And at times, even find a way tactfully and lovingly to correct. Maybe that's not the kind sounding word so that we can adjust each other's paths.",

Want to fight?\" And I had no idea who this man was. I had never seen him before. I didn't know him, but he crossed the street and came after me. And I went running down Stanford Street, try to escape him. So that's how my question came to be feeling physically threatened and really, really scared about living in Boston.",

    "highlight_words": "For me, what's important to me. And I don't think any of the candidates really answered this well is how can we make housing more equitable for everyone in Boston? I've been homeless twice, due to domestic violence. Actually right when the Long Island shelter was closed, right before the hundred inches of snow that we got that winter and I'm grateful and privileged and blessed to have gotten housing after a few months of that. But I observed like when I go over to doctor's appointments over at BMC or being around methadone bile or mass and cast, as some people call it and the situation has gotten more out in the open and it makes me sad and just disappointed to see people not housed. I know that there's some small group that like to be outside because it's hard to be in a shelter, but I don't feel like the city is really doing enough. And I realized that it takes time to build housing, but I wish the city would make an even more stronger stance. And I don't mean just treatment, but having things like there's something called the housing first model where you don't put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, \"You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we'll fill out your verification of homelessness form.\" All these things that just make it that much harder. It's harder to be sober when you're out on the streets. And so, I feel if we had a more listed... I mean, I can't have all the solutions, it's complicated and we could spend literally a whole day talking about just this topic. So for me, I'd like to see the homeless get more shelter and get housing and also to people who've lived here for decades and have been here, I don't like seeing people pushed out to the suburbs, to other states. So we should have housing for medium income levels too and low income and the elderly and disabled and all of that.",

The thing at the forefront of my mind is housing and to people being able to be home and feel home and have security in their homes and have their neighborhoods be familiar. And a lot that comes from my history doing a little bit of organizing in Boston, just on a volunteer basis, over the last five or so years. And then more recently, my work is very focused on, housing and neighborhood planning work and know people's control of their own space. Yeah. I think struggle is... You can't eliminate struggle in the human experience and suffering, but struggle based on, to borrow from Bruce, because of how or where we were born into. Struggles as a result of all the things that divide us. What does a place look like where everybody can be? And by be, I don't mean like coexist without tension. I mean, where we can express ourselves fully and not be worried about getting food on the table and at whatever, whether you're fortunate enough to be, gainfully employed, have a career or wherever you are on the various spectrums of life, to feel whole and to have a rich spiritual and community life. So I don't know where those places are. I think those places exist in every place. I don't know if there's a city where people feel free to be. I think Boston, I think we have a long way to go to be... Yeah, I wouldn't go to Boston first if I had to make a list of those cities, even though one probably doesn't exist.",

I'm 23 years old, but I lived in the city for so long and I've also been born and raised here within and New York. So I was raised here and I was also raised in the Bronx, but one thing I've understood is, not all minorities are accepted in every neighborhood. We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce's ideal is why can't we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can't leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets. So as me, I'm a Roxbury native. I could go as far as South End and feel included because there's many Latinos living there. But as a Roxbury native, when I was working in Cambridge, I felt excluded. I felt like I wasn't a part of that neighborhood, even though that neighborhood is, it's two cities in one. So it's very difficult to say or to view that. Okay, I'm from Boston, I'm from the bean, I'm a Red Sox fan. I'm the official patriarch. There's things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can't just all cross each other's regions. So my thing is when is it that it's going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I'm accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it's very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they're putting in new housings, they're putting in new programs that doesn't really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub. So being the hub, that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. So being that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. And a couple years ago, we was known as the number one city in the country. So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city? Because we're the ones who make Boston real. We're the ones who make it, the way it is, the persona of being a Bostonian, is not these out of state people. That's my difficulty of understanding. Are we really going to be fully accepted or are we not? And that's the end of mine.",
